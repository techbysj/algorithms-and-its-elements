This project contains an algorithm that reads a sentence character by character until a period (`.`) is encountered. Its counts:

- The total number of characters (including the period).
- The number of words (assuming words are separated by single spaces).
- The number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u in either uppercase or lowercase).
